Feature: Full UX discount test
  PrestaShop allows BO users to create discounts
  As a BO user
  I must be able to create discounts using the new discounts

  Background:
    Given there is a customer named "testCustomer" whose email is "pub@prestashop.com"
    Given there is a customer named "testCustomer2" whose email is "pub2@prestashop.com"
    Given language with iso code "en" is the default one
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92
    And shop configuration for "PS_CART_RULE_FEATURE_ACTIVE" is set to 1

  Scenario: Create a complete discount with free gift using new CQRS
    Given I create an empty cart "dummy_cart" for customer "testCustomer"
    Given there is a product "hummingbird-tshirt-simple" with name "Hummingbird printed t-shirt"
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product1" with a price of 20.0 and 1000 items in stock
    When I create a free gift discount "complete_free_gift_discount" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]       | Promotion                 |
      | active            | true                      |

      | gift_product      | hummingbird-tshirt-simple |
    And I add 1 product "product1" to the cart "dummy_cart"
    And cart "dummy_cart" total with tax included should be '$27.00'
    And I use a voucher "complete_free_gift_discount" on the cart "dummy_cart"
    And cart "dummy_cart" total with tax included should be '$27.00'
    Then my cart "dummy_cart" should have the following details:
